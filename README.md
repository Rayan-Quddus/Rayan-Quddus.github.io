# Welcome

Hi, I’m **Rayan Quddus** — a Master’s student in Aerospace Engineering at California State University, Long Beach.

I specialize in thermal systems, multiphase heat transfer, and experimental analysis for aerospace cooling applications.  
This repository hosts my professional website and selected engineering projects.

## 🔬 Research Focus

I investigate high heat-flux pool boiling heat transfer for aerospace avionics cooling applications.  
My work combines experimental diagnostics, IR thermography, high-speed visualization, and data-driven modeling to understand bubble dynamics and surface-fluid interactions.

I develop MATLAB-based post-processing frameworks and explore machine learning approaches to analyze and predict boiling behavior.

The goal is to advance thermal management strategies for compact, high-power-density electronic systems.
