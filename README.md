# Welcome

Hi, I’m **Rayan Quddus** — a Master’s student in **Aerospace Engineering** at **California State University, Long Beach (CSULB)**, focused on **thermal & multiphase systems** (pool/flow boiling), **experimental diagnostics** (IR thermography + high-speed visualization), **NI DAQ + LabVIEW** control, and **CFD**.

## Navigate by Branch (choose what you want to see)

Use the branch dropdown (top-left) to switch to a section:

- 🔬 **Experimental** → branch: `Experimental`  
  *Pool boiling, flow boiling, IR + high-speed visualization, test setup/design*

- ⚙️ **Controls & Data Acquisition** → branch: `Controls-&-Data-Acquisition`  
  *NI DAQ, LabVIEW, 4-SSR heater control, ramp signals, logging*

- 🌊 **CFD & Simulation** → branch: `CFD-&-Simulation`  
  *Cone valve validation, mesh independence, convergence, CFD analysis*

- 📊 **Data Processing, Modeling & CFD Coding** → branch: `Data-Processing,-Modeling-&-CFD-Coding`  
  *MATLAB post-processing (boiling), uncertainty analysis, CFD post-processing scripts, ML bubble analysis*

### Quick Tip
Click the branch selector → pick a branch → open the files in that branch.
